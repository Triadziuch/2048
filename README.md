# 2048
A C++/SFML clone of 2048 game

## Project Description
This project is a result of exploring the SFML library and serves as a testing ground for utilizing my other project, MovementManager. MovementManager is designed to handle smooth movement, scaling, and rotation of various drawable objects from the SFML library, enhancing the visual experience of the game with fluid animations.
